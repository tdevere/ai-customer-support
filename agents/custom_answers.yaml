# These are hard-coded, high-confidence answers that short-circuit the LLM

#   - Policies where a wrong answer would be costly

# Schema per entry
# ----------------
# id          : unique slug (used for analytics / audit)
# topic       : matches an entry in agents/registry.yaml (billing, technical, returns, general)
# patterns    : list of lowercase substrings – if ANY appear in the user message, the
#               answer fires.  Matching is case-insensitive substring search.
# answer      : the exact response text to return
# confidence  : float 0–1 (defaults to 0.95)
# enabled     : set to false to disable without deleting the entry
